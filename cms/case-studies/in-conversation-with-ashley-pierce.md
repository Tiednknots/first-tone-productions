f_project-overview: >-
  Xiaomi tasked Qi Jian Ji Hua with creating four globally shot documentaries
  for their 2022 Imagery Photography Award judges. Despite strict travel
  restrictions, we maintained the director's unified vision through meticulous
  remote coordination. Each shoot ‒ spanning the UK, USA, and China ‒ mirrored
  the same structure, framing, and tone. We set up live sessions for real-time
  director feedback during interviews and ensured every shot matched the
  predefined aesthetic. The result was a seamless, visually harmonized series
  that transcended geographical barriers.
